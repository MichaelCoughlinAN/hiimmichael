Here is my sketch of why there aren't any dissections of a square into
2, 3, or 5 subsquares (there may be holes in it).

Lemma: If a subsquare shares 2 vertices with the big square, then it
_is_ the big square.
Proof: If the 2 vertices are adjacent, then it is clear.  If the two
vertices are opposite, then it is also clear since the 90 degree angles
of the subsquare must be contained in the 90 degree angles at the
opposite vertices of the big square.

This takes care of the cases of dissection into 2 or 3 subsquares,
since in either case, one of the subsquares must share at least two
vertices with the big square, making it equal to the big square and
leaving no room for other squares.

Note that each vertex of the big square must be covered -- by a vertex
of a subsquare, since this is the only way that the 90 degree angle
at a big square vertex can be covered by a subsquare.  Thus there must
be at least 4 subsquares (if there are more than 1) -- one covering
each vertex.

If there are 5 squares, then the one not at a vertex of the big square
is (1) interior to the big square or (2) has an edge along a side of
the big square.

(1) Interior case: each edge of the interior square must lie along an
edge of one of the "corner" squares (since no corner square can share
edge segments with more than one edge of the interior square).  This
leads to the following configuration:
_________________
|     |         |
|     |    D    |
|     |_________|
|  A  |   |     |
|     | S |     |
|_____|___|  C  |
|         |     |
|    B    |     |
|_________|_____|

If A is an axa square, B is bxb, C is cxc, D is dxd, and S is sxs,
then we get the 4 equations:
   a = s + d
   b = s + a
   c = s + b
   d = s + c
which don't have a solution for positive a, b, c, d, and s.

(2) The 5th (non-corner) subsquare has an edge on an edge of the big
square: Assume that the "shared" edge is along the bottom, so that the
situation looks like:
_________________
|               |
|  A        D   |
|               |
|               |
|               |
|      ___      |
|     |   |     |
|  B  | S |  C  |
|_____|___|_____|

Claim: At least one of A or D "overlaps" S (i.e. one of their lower
edges has a segment in common with the top edge of S).  If not, then
then a <= b and d <= c and the only way for the "center" of the top
edge of the big square to be "covered" is for it to be covered by an
edge of S.  Thus the subsquare S is the same height as the big square
and so must be equal to it, leaving no room for A, B, C, and D.

Claim: there is a horizontal or vertical "crack" in the big square --
a line that divides it into two rectangles, one composed of 2 squares
and the other composed of 3 squares.

Case 1. Suppose A overlaps S and C or A overlaps S and D overlaps S
also (note that A overlaps B and D overlaps C always).  Then B, S, and
C are all the same height and their upper edges form a horizontal line
 -- the desired crack.

Case 2. A overlaps S, but D does not.  Then a <= b + s and d <= c.
But a + d = edge length of big square = b + s + c and the only way
this can happen is for a = b + s and d = c, so that the left edges of
C and D form a vertical line -- the desired crack.

Now the only way that a subrectangle of the big square (that shares two
vertices with it) can be dissected into 2 subsquares is for the two
subsquares to have exactly half the edge length of the big square.
Thus the other rectangle (containing 3 subsquares) must be congruent
to the "2-square" rectangle and they both have aspect ratio 2 to 1.
One of the subsquares must cover (at least) two of the vertices of
the "3-square" rectangle, and those two vertices must be adjacent
vertices across one of the "short" ends of the rectangle, and hence
that subsquare covers half of the that rectangle, leaving the other
half (a square) to be covered by the remaining 2 subsquares which is
impossible, as noted above.
