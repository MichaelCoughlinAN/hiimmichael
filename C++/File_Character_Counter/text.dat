Effective: January 3, 2011 
Last Updated: Approved by EPC April 28, 2010; amended and approved by Campus Assembly on November 9, 2010
Policy Owner: Academic Affairs

All 1xxx-5xxx courses offered for undergraduate credit should include a final graded 
component or end of term evaluation that assesses the level of student achievement of one 
or more course objectives.  Instructors are encouraged to design the final component or 
evaluation to be comprehensive and culminating.
1.	 �Final graded component� or �end of term evaluation� may include a written final 
examination, project, composition or performance, demonstration of laboratory 
skills, or presentation.
2.	All final graded components are to be administered or due at the time and place 
according to the final exam schedule and not during the last week of class.  Final 
Exam Week is part of the regular semester calendar.
3.	For courses that end at a time other than the end of the term, final graded 
components are to be administered or due on the last scheduled day of the course.
4.	Comprehensive and culminating means the integration and application of knowledge 
and skills that form the core of the course.
Exemptions to this policy can only be granted by the appropriate department head and 
college or school dean. Exemption documentation must be kept on file in the dean�s 
office. Instructors are responsible for informing students of approved deviations from the 
published final examination schedules.
1.	Requests for exemption must be initiated by the instructor of record for the course 
and forwarded through the department head to the college dean for action.  Such 
requests are considered on a semester-to-semester basis.
2.	Requests for permanent exemption for a course for which regular final graded 
component is inappropriate, such as independent study or seminar courses, should 
be initiated by the sponsoring department and forwarded to the college dean for 
action. Such requests, once granted, remain in effect until modified by action of the 
department.
 
Examination Scheduling Procedures
There are two formats for final examinations, regular final examinations and common final 
examinations. All students are responsible for knowing the final examination scheduling 
information contained in the UMD Class Schedule and the UMD common examination 
schedule.
Regular final examinations are scheduled in accordance with the time and days of semester 
class meetings as indicated in the electronic class schedule documents at: 
http://d.umn.edu/onestop/calendar/final-exam-dates.html. Those classes starting on the 
quarter or half hour use the closest on-hour start time. Example: for a class which normally 
meets at 9:15 or 9:30 T,Th, use the exam schedule for 9:00 T, TH. For classes with multiple 
start times the final exam shall be determined by the day and time of the earliest scheduled 
class period in a normal week.
Common final examinations may be scheduled for courses offered in three or more sections 
and must be requested by the department responsible for the instruction. When one or 
more common exams are scheduled at the same time, priority is given to the earliest class 
time, as determined by the Class Schedule. The common examination schedule is published 
in advance of the semester final examination period.
Final Examination Conflicts
UMD policy provides that no student may be required to take more than two final 
examinations on the same day. The regular final examination and the common examination 
schedules are constructed to minimize conflicts.
Conflicts are resolved according to the following policy. Regular final examinations take 
priority over common final examinations and both take priority over examinations that have 
been shifted to a time deviating from the published examination schedule. When three or 
more regular final examinations fall on the same day for an individual student, the first and 
last scheduled examinations on that day take priority over others. When one regular final 
examination conflicts with two or more common final examinations, the first scheduled 
common final examination on that day takes priority over other common final examinations. 
When three or more common final examinations fall on the same day, the first and last 
scheduled examinations on that day take priority over others. When one or more common 
final examinations are scheduled at the same time, priority is given to the earliest class time 
as determined by the regular class schedule.
Makeup Examinations
When a student is excused from a final examination because of a conflict of more than two exams 
scheduled on the same day, a makeup examination will be scheduled during the final examination period 
on a day and at a time of mutual convenience to the student and faculty member concerned. If mutual 
agreement cannot be reached, the faculty member may specify any time during the final examination 
period that does not create additional conflict with the rest of the student�s scheduled examinations.
