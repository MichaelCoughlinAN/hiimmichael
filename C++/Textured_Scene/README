Standard Compilation - use make (make clean removes unnecessary files).
My image files are not the same as the ones shown in the lab write-up. But, they display 
the same concepts. 

*Note, make sure to look at the test .in files, I am using various 3D objects but it may be hard to tell.

    make
    ./hw5 [input_filename]

Example:
    
    ./hw5 test/image1.in
