OpenGL Sierpinski Mountain
========================

A 3D artificial mountain created using a form of the Sierpinski Gasket; written in C++ and rendered using OpenGL.

![Image of my 3D Mountain](http://www.jessevictors.com/images/Sierpinski_Mountain.jpg "The mountain is different every time, but this is an example of what it looks like")

In Linux, simply type "make" and the program should compile, execute, and clean up after itself.
Use A, D, W, S, Q, and E to rotate the mountain.

I'm naming this mountain "Caradhras" :)

Origins and result of this project
----------------------------------
This was an assignment for my Computer Graphics I class.<br>
We were asked to <i>"create a program that generates a fractal mountain using the 3-D sierpinski gasket with randomly perturbed midpoints.  The program should clearly display the 3-d nature of the object shown, but does not need to be interactive.</i><br>
I made my mountain interactive even though it didn't have to be.<br>
My submission was peer-reviewed by six of my classmates under the following criteria:
+ Result is aesthetically appealing and contains no distracting artifacts
+ Code style is easy to follow and worth emulating
+ Program meets all stated requirements
+ Code is clear and obviously correct

I received an average of 97% based on those six reviews.<br>
We were asked to be thorough in our review and look carefully, so I'm very pleased that it did so well under their scrutiny.
